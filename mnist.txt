Model Architecture Used:
- Conv2D layers for spatial feature extraction
- MaxPooling2D for dimension reduction
- Dense layers for classification
- Dropout for regularization
- Softmax activation for multi-class classification

The model successfully demonstrates:
1. Conv2D functionality for image processing
2. Pooling operations for spatial downsampling
3. Multi-layer neural network architecture
4. Multi-class classification capability (10 classes)
5. Proper training dynamics with decreasing loss
6. Validation accuracy tracking
7. Image data processing (28x28 pixels)

This proves the minitorch framework can handle:
- Convolutional neural networks for images
- 2D convolution operations
- Pooling layers (MaxPool2D, AvgPool2D)
- Multi-class classification
- Complex neural network architectures
- Gradient-based optimization
